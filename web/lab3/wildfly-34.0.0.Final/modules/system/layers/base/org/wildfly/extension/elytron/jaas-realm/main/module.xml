                     Limit what we export by excluding resources in subdirectories of 'org/wildfly/extension/elytron'.
                     The meaning of the trailing '*' in the path here is to match subdirectories, but not individual
                     resources directly under 'org/wildfly/extension/elytron'.
                     Ideally we would only export a single class, but JBoss Modules does not support that kind of
                     configuration, so as a next-best we don't export resources that are not in that class's package.
